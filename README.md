# Programming Paradigms

CSI2520 : Paradigmes de programmation | CSI2120: Programming Paradigms | University of Ottawa  

These are the solutions I submitted for the Integrator Project in Java, Go, Prolog and Scheme. 

# I will not post the questions because they belong to the University of Ottawa. 

I am only posting the codes and files I submitted. 

This project is about solving the Knapsack Problem in 4 four different paradigms with the specified approach

→ In Java : Dynamic Approach and Brute Force Approach
→ In Go : BruteForce Approach using Goroutines and recursive approach 
→ In Prolog : Dynamic Approach
→ In Scheme : Brute Force Approach

External resources were authorized for building each project. 

# Beware of Copy Pasting these codes  :D. 

I am posting the code I submitted because It was a great experience to follow this class
during the term. 

I had the opportunity to work with programming languages such as Prolog, Scheme and Go

# Make your own code, find your own mistakes, customize your code and learn!
